+ Planned to rebuild the AD10

> ### After Summer'19

+ Designed new Software architecture for the future AD10 replacement, keeping flexibity and scalabilÃ­ty in mind. #July-Aug'19

+ Created [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/javatutorial) based data containers and implemented persistence storage and data acquisition (in a simulated environement).#Aug'19 

+ Added [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) based framework allowing clients to control the harware via the server and also to subscribe to data streamed from the server using gRPC schema. #Aug-Sep'19

+ Designed and partially implemented a cloud based distributed file storage system for three types of data files created by the framework (raw sensor data, processed data, trained models) with support for statical information on files/file system usage. #Sep'19

+ Implemented realtime and saved data plotter for visualizing the data on the client and server side. #Sep'19

+ Built a *sensor board* based on [IMU](todo:link)(Accelerometer/magenetometer) and [digital halleffect](todo:addlink) sensor to record rpm of the DrillBit and the feeder. #Sep-Oct'19

+ Added support to control (old logic) the AD10 (using Time of Filght sensor, xbee interface) #Oct'19
 
+ Planned on a strategy to control the new hardware (before Nov'19) in threee steps:
    + Record the rpm from the drill bit using the *sensor board*. Develop a controller using the rpm data as the fundemental input.
    + Create an drillbit rpm *estimator* using machine learning based on data collected from the new hardware and the *sensor board*.
    + Replace rpm from *sensor board* with estimated rpm from the machine learning *estimator*  in the controller.

## Updated strategy in response to new requirements (hardware and sofware)

> ### updates on hardware

+ The AD10 had built in logic for fail-safe and feeder control which severely limited the options for developing the AutomaticControl based on AI. The new hardware on the other hand doesn't have any of these constraints.

+ The new hardware replacement requires the Automatic Drill Controller (AI) to implement the feeder fail-safes and control logic.

+ Latency in old radio control via xbee was high (permited max.10Hz update rate) but the new hardware permits much lower latency (permits milli second scale)

+ The new hardware provides data on the feeder motor speed which is'nt available on the AD10.

> ### New Software architecture

+ In response to the updates in hardware and communication a new sofware system architecture is designed keeping flexibility and scalability in mind.

+ The new framework is centered around unsing [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) for comunication and [protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/javatutorial) for seriazation (in place of [ZeroMQ](https://zeromq.org/languages/python/) and [custom serializer](https://www.json.org/)) since this reduces development time and minimizes required tests if communication schema is updated.

+ The data rate of the new hardware is considerably higher, only meta data is stored in the database. The time series data is stored in a file (accumulated protobuf containers) based starage system (previously all data was stored in one table). 

+ The new framework supports easy integration of new hardware or simulated hardware types. This functionality is important because the specification for the new hardware is not complete yet.
